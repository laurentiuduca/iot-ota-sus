# OTA Secure Update System for IoT Fleets

We present an Over-The-Air secure and scalable update system for Internet of Things fleets 
which run embedded Linux. The system uses the SWUpdate Linux update agent and Eclipse hawkBit framework 
to offer a scalable and server and client fault tolerant update mechanism for IoT fleets where no physical access is 
available.  Security  is  achieved  using  the  Linux  OpenSSL  library.  By  using  Buildroot  we  implement  a  complete 
automated build system. The test is made on the cheap and handy Raspberry Pi Zero W.
